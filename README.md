# Matrix

Stand-alone Linear Algebra Library for PHP

## Installation

Include this in your composer.json and then run `composer install`:

    "mcordingley/linearalgebra": "0.3.*"

## Usage

Instantiate a new instance of the matrix class like so:

    $matrix = new \mcordingley\LinearAlgebra\Matrix([
        [0, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8]
    ]);

You can also generate an identity matrix with the `identity` factory function:

    $threeByThreeIdentityMatrix = \mcordingley\LinearAlgebra\Matrix::identity(3);

With the matrix instance, you can retrieve individual elements with `get` using
the zero-based indices of the row and column that you want:

    $element = $matrix->get($row, $column);

It's also possible to find out how large the matrix is with the `rows` and
`columns` properties:

    $rows = $matrix->rows;
    $columns = $matrix->columns;

You can also add, subtract, and multiply the matrix with scalar values and other
matrices. All operations return a new Matrix and do not modify the underlying matrix:

    $addedScalar = $matrix->add(3);
    $addedMatrix = $matrix->add($anotherMatrix);
    $subtractedScalar = $matrix->subtract(2);
    $subtractedMatrix = $matrix->subtract($anotherMatrix);
    $multipliedByScalar = $matrix->multiply(4);
    $multipliedByMatrix = $matrix->multiply($anotherMatrix);

Matrices can be compared with `equals` to see if they're equal:

    if ($matrix1->equals($matrix2)) {
        // Equality for all!
    }

In addition to these basic operations, the Matrix class offers other common
matrix operations:

    $matrix->inverse()
    $matrix->adjoint()
    $matrix->determinant()
    $matrix->trace()
    $matrix->transpose()
    $matrix->submatrix()

It's also possible to run a map over the matrix:

    $squaredElements = $matrix->map(function($element, $row, $column, $matrix) {
        return $element * $element
    });

The LinearAlgebra library also supports Vectors that can be constructed like so:

    $vector = new \mcordingley\LinearAlgebra\Vector([0, 1, 2]);

As a child class of `Matrix`, Vectors behave the same way as their parent class,
with the exception that `get` and `set` support short-hand access (e.g. `$vector->get(1)`)
and vectors will automatically be transposed if necessary when multiplied together.

## Change-log


    - Renamed `eq` to `equals`.
    - Removed `set` function, so instantiated objects are immutable.

- 0.3.0
    - Added the `identity` factory function
    - Using Cholesky decomposition for faster matrix inversions for applicable matrices

- 0.2.0
    - Created the Vector type
    - `\MCordingley` namespace is now `\mcordingley`
    - Matrix functions that return a new Matrix now return a new instance of the called class
