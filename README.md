Stand-alone Linear Algebra Library for PHP

## Installation

    composer require mcordingley/LinearAlgebra

Alternately, include this in your composer.json and then update:

    "mcordingley/linearalgebra": "^3.0.0"

If Composer isn't an option for you, clone this repository and run `build-phar.php` to generate a phar
archive that you can include into your project. PHP will autoload classes from inside the archive as needed.

## Usage

### Matrix

Start with a `use` statement for the class:

    use MCordingley\LinearAlgebra\Matrix;

Then, instantiate a new instance of the matrix class like so:

    $matrix = new Matrix([
        [0, 1, 2],
        [3, 4, 5],
        [6, 7, 8]
    ]);

You can also generate an identity matrix with the `identity` factory function:

    $threeByThreeIdentityMatrix = Matrix::identity(3);

With the matrix instance, you can retrieve individual elements with `get` using
the zero-based indices of the row and column that you want:

    $element = $matrix->get($row, $column);

It's also possible to find out how large the matrix is with `getRowCount()` and `getColumnCount()`:

    $rows = $matrix->getRowCount();
    $columns = $matrix->getColumnCount();

You can also add, subtract, and multiply the matrix with scalar values and other
matrices. All operations return a new Matrix and do not modify the underlying matrix:

    $addedScalar = $matrix->addScalar(3);
    $addedMatrix = $matrix->addMatrix($anotherMatrix);
    $subtractedScalar = $matrix->subtractScalar(2);
    $subtractedMatrix = $matrix->subtractMatrix($anotherMatrix);
    $multipliedByScalar = $matrix->multiplyScalar(4);
    $multipliedByMatrix = $matrix->multiplyMatrix($anotherMatrix);

Matrices can be compared with `equals` to see if they're equal:

    if ($matrix1->equals($matrix2)) {
        // Equality for all!
    }

In addition to these basic operations, the Matrix class offers other common
matrix operations:

    $matrix->inverse()
    $matrix->adjugate()
    $matrix->determinant()
    $matrix->trace()
    $matrix->transpose()

You can get the upper and lower triangular matrices by calling `upper(bool)` and `lower(bool)`. The lone argument tells
whether the main diagonal of the triangular matrix should be set to ones (`true`) or the value of the parent matrix
(`false`).

It's also possible to run a map over the matrix:

    $squaredElements = $matrix->map(function($element, $row, $column, $matrix) {
        return $element * $element
    });

Submatrices may be extracted with `sliceColumns($offset, $length)` and `sliceRows($offset, $length)`. The semantics of
the arguments are the same as PHP's `array_slice`.

Similarly, `spliceColumns($offset, $length, $replacement)` and `spliceRows($offset, $length, $replacement)` can be used
to create new matrices with specific rows or columns removed or replaced. Unlike the native PHP `array_splice`, these
operations do not modify the matrix in place and return the removed elements, but instead return a new matrix with the
splice applied.

If you need to combine together matrices, you can do so by calling the concatenation methods:

    $m1 = new Matrix([
      [1,2,3],
      [4,5,6],
    ]);

    $m2 = new Matrix([
      [7],
      [8],
    ]);

    $m3 = new Matrix([[3,2,1]]);

    $m4 = $m1->concatenateRight($m2);
    //  [
    //      [1,2,3,7],
    //      [4,5,6,8],
    //  ]

    $m5 = $m1->concatenateBottom($m3);
    // [
    //     [1,2,3],
    //     [4,5,6],
    //     [3,2,1],
    // ]

LU and LUP decomposition methods are available as separate classes and both expose `lower()` and `upper()` for the L
and U portions of the decompositions, respectively. The LUP decomposition additionally exposes `permutationMatrix` and
`permutationArray` to fetch the P component of the decomposition as well as `parity` to return the total number of
pivots performed.

### Vector

As with `Matrix`, import the class into your current namespace:

    use MCordingley\LinearAlgebra\Vector;

Since a `Vector` is a special case of a `Matrix`, `Vector` inherits from `Matrix`. As such, every method available on
`Matrix` is also available on `Vector`. `Vector` also exposes additional methods specific to working with vectors.

Creating a `Vector` differs from creating a `Matrix` only in that the constructor takes an array of scalars, rather
than an array of arrays:

    $vector = new Vector([1, 2, 3, 4]);

Note that `Vector` instances are all row vectors. If you need a column vector, `transpose()` the vector to get a
`Matrix` with a single column.

If you need to cast a `Matrix` into a `Vector`, call the factory method `fromMatrix()`:

    $vector = Vector::fromMatrix($matrix);

`toArray()` is overridden to return an array of scalars to mirror how the constructor works. It is equivalent to
calling `$matrix->toArray()[0]` on a `Matrix` instance.

`getSize()` is provided as an alias for `getColumnCount()`. `sum()` will return the sum of the `Vector` elements,
while `dotProduct($otherVector)` will return the sum of the pair-wise products of `$vector` and `$otherVector`,
and is also availabe aliased as `innerProduct($otherVector)`. `outerProduct($otherVector)` will return a new Matrix
representing the outer product of the two vectors. `crossProduct($otherVector)` is also available. Vectors may be
normalized with `normalize()`. They may also be projected onto other vectors with `project($otherVector)`. The
Euclidean distance may also be calculated between two vectors with `euclideanDistance($otherVector)`.

For measures of vector magnitude, `l1Norm()`, `l2Norm()`, and `maxNorm()` are all available, with `length()` as
an alias for `l2Norm()`.
